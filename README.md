# Project I: Flight Simulator
# CS 440 Computer Graphics, Fall 2021
***

# Purpose

This project assesses your mastery of viewing transformations. It brings together many of the topics we cover in Module II. These are:

- viewing
- shading
- interaction
- geometry

# Background

For this assignment, you should
- be able to visualize 3D Cartesian space
- understand camera parameters and their representation in WebGL
- be able to capture user interaction and have it effect your WebGL program
- know the various shading schemes
- be able to judge the best platform (CPU/application program vs. GPU/shader) to execute a desired functionality
- be able to apply trigonometric operations
- understand the memory interaction between the CPU and the GPU
- know WebGL's coordinate system and drawing routines
- be able to write one or more files in order to display GPU-supported renderings in an HMTL page
- be able to look up, where necessary, and implement the functions and syntax in HTML, JavaScript, and WebGL for desired functionality.

# The Problem Set

The problems are defined in `proj1.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

# Time Requirement

Based on feedback from the last set of students that attempted this assignment, the number of hours that your team will require to complete this homework are as follows.

- (min, max) : (24, 200)
- (mean, median, st.dev.) : (80.65, 57.5, 52.1)

# Submission

There are 2 parts to the submission. There is no peer review as the submission will be graded by WS.

## 1. Problem Set

Please follow the naming instructions exactly. The correctly named files in your GitHub repository at the time of the deadline will be considered your submission. Your submission will be graded _as is_, so make sure to include all the necessary files.

This is a team submission on GitHub and contributes to your _Submission Score_.

_Deadline_: 2359h on Sunday, 7 November.

## 2. Feedback Form

You will provide feedback on your buddies and on the project. The feedback form will be available on LMS with further instructions and will be due at the same time as the problem set.

This is an individual submission on LMS and contributes to your individual _Team Factor_ which is 1 by default and penalized for non-submission or non-participation in the team as assessed through peer feedback or GitHub contribution.

_Deadline_: 2359h on Sunday, 7 November.

# Grading

Your submission will be graded as per the criteria specified in the accompanying file, _rubric.xlsx_. This will contribute to your _Submission Score_.

Your individual score in this homework is the product of your Submission Score and Team Factor.

# Fun Stuff

Students tend to get carried away and implement many additional features. There is nothing wrong with that! While these will not earn extra marks, please state them clearly on the main page so that I am aware of your additional effort.

# Discussion

There is a lot to handle and there are bound to be confusions and queries. Please share them using the following avenues.

- discuss with your buddies,
- the corresponding discussion thread on LMS,
- discuss with your peers,
- consult with course staff.

# Tips

- This project involves a lot of work so start early.
- There is no late submission. Submit whatever you have by the deadline.
- Failure to turn in any of the above submissions will result in a deduction of marks for the homework.
- viel Spa√ü!
